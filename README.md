# draft1:
  massive grid of things
  little guys
  when its movement time
  you tell them all where to go
  there is a 60 sec interval where they can do that
  then the movement phase
  then collisions can happen
  as the sequential movement thing happens 


#Simplest:
  all squares black but 1 white one
  click it during the move phase and move it
  then do the move pahse

# simplest version 2
